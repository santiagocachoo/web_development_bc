<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m a curious and creative person who loves exploring new ideas and turning
  them into something real. Over time, I’ve found myself diving into all kinds
  of projects, whether it’s programming, problem solving, design, or
  entrepreneurial experiments, all with the goal of learning, building, and
  enjoying the process. I like breaking things down step by step until they make
  sense, and then pushing myself to see how far I can take them.

  Outside of projects, I’m all about music. Listening, producing, jamming on the
  guitar, or chasing down new sounds; it’s a big part of how I stay inspired and
  creative. When I’m not lost in music, you’ll probably find me reading,
  running, or just exploring something new that catches my curiosity. I love
  learning in all its forms, whether it’s a book, a new skill, or an unexpected
  idea.

  This portfolio is basically a snapshot of that mix: my drive to learn, my love
  for creating, and the different passions that keep me moving forward
  (sometimes literally, when I’m running).
